			<h1 align="center">LAB SUMMARY</h1>
				<p>This lab was focused on basic Javascript variables and data types as a starter to more Javascript work later on. We experimented with it using the Javascript Console in our browsers, and then moving to the actual Javascript file in Sublime to recreate what we did in the Console.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
			<h1 align="center">CHALLENGES</h1>
				<p>We had no major challenges with this lab, as it was pretty straightforward and simple. We did forget what booleans were, but we were able to move on smoothly with a brief look back at the lecture.</p>
