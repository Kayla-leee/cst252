			<h1 align="center">LAB SUMMARY</h1>
				<p>For this lab, we were to replicate the Javascript from Lab 14 and use it for this lab. The slight difference was that we use classes instead of prototypes for the JS code. However, Ashlyn and I realized that we already used classes for Lab 14, so we didn't have to modify anything for this lab. We would have to go back to modify Lab 14 later on. We then created a section for an OOP Design for the game Hangman.</p>

		<div class="text">
			<h1 align="center">CHALLENGES</h1>
				<p>We didn't have much challenges with this lab. We did struggle a little bit with the pseudocode, since we didn't know what to put. We ended up using the lecture notes for reference, which really helped, especially with #3 and #4 of the OOP.</p>

			<h1 align="center">RESULTS</h1>
				<p>The pseudocodes and JS-ish pseudocodes are in the OOP Design section below.</p>

			<h1>OOP Design</h1>
				<h2>1. Understand the Problem</h2>
					<p>• Set up game with board and players<br>
						• Game loop<br>
						• Draw the board<br>
						• Choose random word<br>
						• Get guess from player<br>
						• Validate letter<br>
						• Check for correct or wrong letter<br>
						• Finish game if player has guessed the word or completed the body</p>
				<h2>2. Pseudocode the High Level Approach</h2>
					<pre>Set up game
   Create game board
Create players
   Start game loop
   Render board
   Generate random word
   Display length of word to players
   Get letters from guessers and validate 
   If letter is correct, display on letter line
   If wrong, draw body part on hanger
   Display wrong guess on the side
If game should end
   Display victory or loss message
   Stop looping
Else
   Switch to next player and keep looping</pre>
				<h2>3. Assign Actions to Objects</h2>
				<pre>Set up game [hangman]
   Create game board [board]
Create players [player]
   Start game loop [hangman]
   Render board [board]
   Generate random word [hangman]
   Display length of word to players [board]
   Get letters from guessers and validate [player]
   If letter is correct, display on letter line [board]
   If wrong, draw body part on hanger [board]
   Display wrong guess on the side
If game should end [hangman]
   Display victory or loss message
   Stop looping
Else
   Switch to next player and keep looping [hangman]</pre>
				<h2>4. Make Javascript-ish Pseudocode</h2>
				<pre>
class Hangman
    initialize
        set up board
        set up players
        set up starting player

    play
        loop infinitely
            call the board rendering method
            generate random word
            display length of word to players
            get letters from guessers and validate

    check_game_over
        check_victory
        check_loss

    check_victory
        if board says word is complete
            display victory message

    check_loss
        if board says body is complete
            display loss message</pre>
