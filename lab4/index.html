			<h1 align="center">LAB SUMMARY</h1>
				<p>For this lab, we learned how to pseudocode using a Javascript file, and turning them into comments. We haven't learned how to do anything with Javascript yet, but pseudocoding seems like a start. As for the problem-solving portion, we were to come up with two sets of basic, or "high-level," instructions: how to shuffle a deck of cards, and creating a rock, paper, scissors game on your computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
			<h1 align="center">CHALLENGES</h1>
				<p>We struggled a little bit with Atom, since we used it to collaborate this time to work on the instructions together, instead of working separately on Sublime (even though we both prefer Sublime). Perhaps it could be due to connection issues, but if either one of us were idle on Atom for at least 1-2 minutes, it would kick the collaborator out of the portal. This occurred around 4 times. It wasn't exactly an obstruction to our workflow, but it was quite annoying as it kept happening. Another thing we struggled with was coming up with the right terms for the instructions. It was difficult for us to explain the computer task because we didn't know the proper technical terms for it. Maybe it didn't matter for this lab, but we still wanted to make it sound proper. Any other minor issues were solved quickly as we communicated via Zoom this time.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text">
			<h1 align="center">RESULTS</h1>
				<p>The results of the instruction outlines and Javascript comments/pseudocoding can be seen in the sections above. From this lab and corresponding lecture, I learned what high-level tasks are, although I'm not sure if our instructions in this lab are high-level enough.</p>
