			<h1 align="center">LAB SUMMARY</h1>
				<p>This lab was focused on creating a function that depends on conditionals. Like the previous lab, we created an input form field with a button that has a function connected to it. Instead of a Harry Potter sorting hat function, Ashlyn and I decided to put our own twist to it. Ashlyn's function has a conditional that returns the Warrior Cat Clans (4), and mine returns the Eeveelutions (8) of Eevee, the Pokemon. We used Wes' JS code for reference from the screenshots on the lab assignment page.</p>

			<h1 align="center">CHALLENGES</h1>
				<p>We had little to no challenges with this lab, as we had Wes' screenshots for reference, thankfully. However, since it was a bit simple, we decided to attempt Question 1 of the bonus, which was to return a description of the output. Ashlyn attempted said return, but could not figure out how. I attempted something different; I wanted it to return an image of each Eevee evolution that corresponds to each mod value. Even after searching up how to do so from sources such as W3Schools and Stack Overflow, I couldn't find one that is simple enough for me to understand. I'm sure there is a way to return images with mods/conditionals, but for now, that will be an issue for later.</p>
