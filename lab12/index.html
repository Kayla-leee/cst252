			<h1 align="center">LAB SUMMARY</h1>
				<p>For this lab, we experimented with loops in Javascript. We created a for loop that printed out the numbers 1-200, where certain numbers would print out a word instead of the number. After making sure it worked in the browser console, we were to print our output onto our page. We came across issues with that, even after reviewing the lecture, using Wes' suggested code from Slack, and asking fellow classmates. I eventually looked back at my previous labs and figured out how to make the output print on the page in a way that made sense to me. It's obviously not the most professional or proper way to make it work, but it worked. For the bonus, styling the output into neat columns was not difficult, as we used CSS attributes from W3Schools to do so.</p>

			<h1 align="center">CHALLENGES</h1>
				<p>Our main challenge for this lab was outputting the loop onto our page. Things stopped working as soon as we made the loop within a function, similar to how it is shown in Wes' screenshot of his JS code in the lab assignment page. After Wes dropped a little guide + codes on Slack for us to use and add to, we still couldn't figure out how to make the two connect and print on the page. We consulted with our Project Group members (we met up to do the Midterm Questionnaire together), and we could not figure out a solution.</p>
				<p>After calling it a day, I decided to scavange for a way to make it work. I thought back to my previous labs (Lab 10 and 11), where it was easier to just place everything inside the main code. To clarify, in Lab 10 where I borrowed my friend's code, all the DOM elements, sorting arrays, and innerHTML codes were inside the Event Listener button. In Lab 11, I wanted to return certain images that corresponded to each mod value, as part of the bonus. My inital attempt was using DOM elements to summon the images in the Event Listener, and then connecting that to the modulus function. I struggled with that, so I found that just inputting the image sources/links with the conditionals was easier. It worked, so I did the same thing for this lab.</p>
