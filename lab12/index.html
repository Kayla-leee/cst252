			<h1 align="center">LAB SUMMARY</h1>
				<p>For this lab, we experimented with loops in Javascript. We created a for loop that printed out the numbers 1-200, where certain numbers would print out a word instead of the number. After making sure it worked in the browser console, we were to print our output onto our page. We came across issues with that, even after reviewing the lecture, using Wes' suggested code from Slack, and asking fellow classmates. I eventually looked back at my previous labs and figured out how to make the output print on the page in a way that made sense to me. It's obviously not the most professional or proper way to make it work, but it worked. For the bonus, styling the output into neat columns was not difficult, as we used CSS attributes from W3Schools to do so.</p>

			<h1 align="center">CHALLENGES</h1>
				<p>Our main challenge for this lab was outputting the loop onto our page. Things stopped working as soon as we made the loop within a function, similar to how it is shown in Wes' screenshot of his JS code in the lab assignment page. After Wes dropped a little guide + codes on Slack for us to use and add to, we still couldn't figure out how to make the two connect and print on the page. We consulted with our Project Group members (we met up to do the Midterm Questionnaire together), and we could not figure out a solution.</p>
				<p>After we called it a day, I decided to scavenge for a way to make it work. I thought more about the second way Wes provided to print the output on the page, which was, "For each number, create a new DOM element, change the innerHTML to the text you want, and appendChild() to the end of your output div." Ashlyn and I initially thought it would be too tedious to do that method, so we glazed over that until Wes suggested it in Slack. I eventually made it work by using the same method as I did for Lab 11's bonus, which I later realized that that might have been what Wes meant in the instructions I quoted.</p>
