			<h1 align="center">LAB SUMMARY</h1>
				<p>This lab was supposed to be experimenting GitHub and getting used to using it. However, we are already use GitHub as a server, therefore we already completed this lab. We have also completed Task X by default because our team had already created a team repository for the term project. We didn't have to do much, or anything, at all, but we did learn a few new things from the lecture this assignment was based on.</p>
